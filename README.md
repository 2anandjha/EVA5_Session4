# EVA5_Session4
The purpoe of this document is to reduce the number of parmeters in trainingdate set ,maintaing an accuracy .
The kernal choosen for the first layer is 7 ,follwed by 1 ,1 .
The acuuracy is mangaed at increasing order fro 90% to 96%.

Global average pooling has been used over Fully connected layers.FCs are not used to avoid the issue spatial data ( converting n dimesional data into 1d array,and loosing space information)
